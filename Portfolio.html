        <p>Hello, my name is Arju Hussain and I am an entering sophomore at Wayne State University. I am working on my bachelor’s degree in Public Health and I hope to become an optometrist. While I may like the sciences, I have always had a side interest in computers and wanted to learn about how to build them, coding and other cool things about them. GDYT More Than Code program allowed me to learn more about coding and I have gained a new important skill which I can use throughout my life.</p>
        <p>An interesting fact about me is that I have lived in Detroit my whole life ever since I was born which means I’ve been living in the same house for over 19 years! I have an older brother, younger sister and brother along with living with my mom and dad. Even though my parents came to America as immigrants, I hope to make the best out of every opportunity and resource that I can get so I can become a successful and inspiring practitioner. My hobbies are playing basketball with friends, watching day in the life vlogs of aspiring doctors, and just having a good time with people.</p>

              <p>In two years I will be almost done with my bachelor’s degree in Public Health from Wayne State  and ready to apply to optometry school. In five years, I will be in optometry school whether it is Ferris State University or anywhere else that I get into. In ten years, I see myself as a practicing optometrist teaching others about the importance of taking good care of the eye.</p>
